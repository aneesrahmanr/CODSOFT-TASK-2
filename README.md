# CODSOFT-TASK-2
As part of my CodSoft Data Science Internship, I worked on building a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud. Here's a quick overview of the key steps involved:

Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset containing historical credit card transactions. This dataset should include features like transaction amount, time,V1 .. V28 and whether the transaction was fraudulent or not i.e Class.

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing data, outliers, and duplicate records. Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features. Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. Exploratory 

Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the data to understand its distribution and characteristics. Identify patterns, trends, and potential anomalies in legitimate and fraudulent transactions. 

Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for fraud detection. Common choices include: 
Logistic Regression 
Decision Trees
 Random Forest 
 Support Vector Machines

Model Training: Train the selected models on the training data. Implement techniques to handle class imbalance (fraudulent transactions are often rare compared to legitimate ones).

Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. Consider the business impact of false positives and false negatives in your evaluation.
